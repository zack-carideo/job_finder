given the information in job_results.json , 
create a new python script that takes job_results.json as an input
, along with a users current resume and coverletter
, and perform the below actions. 

1) use the job description, the job name
, and the company name from job_results.json
, paired with a path to an existing resume and cover letter
; update the cover letter to reflect the job description 
, job title, and company name, and update the resume (if needed) 
to better align with the job description. A path to the original cover 
letter and resume should be part of the config.

coverletter as new keys in the dictionary of information associated with each job.
